      <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
      <p>
        This website was created for my first web development class. Before this course,
        I had never built a webpage, so this project is helping me understand how websites
        are structured and how content is organized using HTML.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the biggest things I am learning is that websites are not just about how
        they look. They are built with meaning behind the structure. Using elements like
        sections, articles, and headings helps explain what each part of the page is for.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is a place where I can practice those skills and continue improving as
        I learn more throughout the semester.

      <h2>What I Am Learning</h2>
      <p>
        In this class, I am learning how to write clean and organized HTML using semantic
        elements. Instead of just putting everything into generic containers, I am learning
        how to describe content properly so that both people and computers can understand it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This approach helps make websites easier to navigate, more accessible, and easier
        to maintain in the future. It also builds a strong foundation before adding styling
        or advanced features later on.

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        As I continue learning web development, I hope to apply these skills in real-world
        situations. Understanding how websites work is useful in many careers and can be
        applied to business, sports organizations, and personal projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is just the beginning, but it is an important first step in learning how the web works.
