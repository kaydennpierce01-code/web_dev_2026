      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Kayden Pierce, and I am from Frankfort, Kentucky.
        I am currently taking my first web development class, and this website
        is part of learning how to build and structure webpages using HTML.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work for <a href="https://ukathletics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK Athletics</a>, 
        which has given me the opportunity to be around college sports and see how much organization and teamwork goes into events.
        Being part of that environment has made me interested in combining my passion
        for sports with useful technical skills like web development.
      </p>

      <p>
        This class is helping me understand how websites are created from the ground up.
        I am learning that building a site is not just about how it looks, but about how
        information is organized so people can easily read and understand it.

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy watching sports, playing video games, traveling,
        and spending time with my friends. Sports have always been a big part of my life,
        especially following University of Kentucky teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traveling is something I enjoy because it allows me to experience new places
        and step away from everyday routines. Whether it is for sports events or just
        for fun, I like seeing different environments and meeting new people.
      </p>

      <h2>A Moment I Enjoyed</h2>
      <p>
        The photo below shows a moment after a big basketball win. Experiences like this
        are one of the reasons I enjoy being involved with athletics and why I hope to
        continue working in the sports field in the future.
