            <h2>About This Page</h2>
            <p>
                This page shows how contact information can be organized using semantic HTML.
                Instead of using layout tricks, the information is placed inside a table because
                it represents structured data. Each row shows a different way to contact me.
            </p>

            <p>
                If this website were expanded in the future, this page would include a contact form
                so visitors could send messages directly. For this assignment, we are focusing on
                structure and meaning rather than building a working form.

            <h2>Future Form Idea</h2>
            <p>
                A future version of this site could include a contact form that collects a visitors
                name, email address, and message. This would make communication easier and allow users
                to interact with the site instead of only reading information.
